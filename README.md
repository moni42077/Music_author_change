# Music_author_change
The idea for this program was born from the giant amount of songs I had on my phone and a lot of them had their author(artist) in the title. So I made a program that is taking the author(artist) from the title and moves it to the author(title) position.

About the program:
Since there is a problem with Korean, Japanese and Chinese symbols I have included a script that is taking those songs and moving them to another folder. For songs that had some strange symbols in them or for some other reason failed to load are send to another folder.
